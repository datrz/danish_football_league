# Superliga Dashboard

The aim of this project was to visualise Danish football league data, in an interactive environment where the user is able to do a basic analysis by choosing their own variables and parameters. We have created the visualisation using Streamlit which is an open-source library used for building data science web applications. It enables data scientists and engineers to create interactive and dynamic data visualizations, dashboards, and machine learning models with ease.Try it out by clicking the link below.

**Note:** The Streamlit link, may have to be rebooted. It should not take more than 30 seconds.

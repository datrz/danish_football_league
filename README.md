# Superliga Streamlit Dashboard

The aim of this project was to visualise Danish football league data (Superliga data from 2013-2023), in an interactive environment where the user should be able to do basic analysis by choosing their own variables and parameters. We have created the visualisation using Streamlit which is an open-source library used for building data science web applications.

**Note:** The Streamlit link, may have to be rebooted. It should not take more than 30 seconds.
